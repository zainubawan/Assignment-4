Bugs 8, 11 and 12 are customized options to add in the program.
They do not exist in the program hence there cant be any tests 
conducted to show their buggy behaviour.
Test code for the rest of the bugs has been submitted since it
already existed in the original program causing it to notfunction properly.

Bugs 8, 11 and 12 will increase program functionality but without them the
program is still working up to its potential.
